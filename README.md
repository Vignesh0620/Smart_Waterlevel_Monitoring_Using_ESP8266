# Smart_Waterlevel_Monitoring_Using_ESP8266
Smart Water Tank Monitoring System This project implements a Smart Water Tank Monitoring System using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU), an ultrasonic sensor, and Blynk for remote monitoring. The system is designed to monitor the water level in a tank and provide real-time feedback through LEDs and a Blynk app.
Features:
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the water level in the tank using an ultrasonic sensor.

LED Indicators: Five LEDs represent different water level stages (20% increments), providing a visual indication of the current water level.

Blynk Integration: Utilizes the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control. The water level is displayed on a Gauge Widget in the Blynk app.

Overflow Prevention: A relay is employed to turn off a motor when the water level reaches the maximum capacity, preventing overflow.

Hardware Setup:
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the designated GPIO pins (trigPin and echoPin).
Connect the LEDs to GPIO pins D4 to D8.
Connect the relay to GPIO pin D3.
Usage:
Install the necessary libraries (ESP8266WiFi, Blynk) in the Arduino IDE.
Set up a Blynk account and create a project with a Gauge Widget (V0).
Replace placeholders in the code with your Blynk authentication token, Wi-Fi credentials, and hardware connections.
Upload the code to the ESP8266 board.
Note:
Adjust the code or hardware connections based on your specific requirements.
This project is designed for educational purposes and can be extended for various applications involving water level monitoring.
